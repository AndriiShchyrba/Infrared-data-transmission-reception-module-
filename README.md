# Infrared-data-transmission-reception-module-
Device development from idea to finished product with all processes and complexities. Processes such as block diagram design, schematic diagram, code design, block diagram code presentation, program code writing and debugging, microcontroller compilation and firmware, circuit diagram development and design, testing of the finished prototype for possible errors during operation will be considered. The idea of ​​the device is to receive an IR signal and use a transmitter to read and redirect to another source of IR beam.
